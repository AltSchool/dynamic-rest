# 2.0.0
Major release of DREST that includes core API-ORM translation improvements and a robust admin renderer. Compatability with 1.x is likely but not guaranteed, many private APIs have changed, some setting defaults have changed.

## Boilerplate

- Added integration with [dj](https://github.com/aleontiev/dj), including an `api` blueprint that can be used to bootstrap a new view/serializer:

```
    dj add dynamic-rest
    dj generate model product
    dj generate api v0 product
```

## Fields

- `dynamic_rest.fields.DynamicRelationField`
    - New initialization arguments: `getter` and `setter`
        - Allows for custom relationship getting and setting.
          This can be useful for simplifying complex "through" relations.

    - Argument change: `serializer_class` is now optional
        - `DynamicRelationField` will attempt to infer `serializer_class` from the
          given source using `DynamicRouter.get_canonical_serializer`.

- New dynamic model fields: `dynamic_rest.fields.model`
    - These fields add dynamic-value support to base DRF fields.
      Dynamic values are values that can contain metadata used
      by higher-level renderers (admin), such as styling directives.
      At a lower-level (JSON), only the base value is rendered.
      See `dynamic_rest.fields.DynamicChoicesField`.

## Serializers

- New setting: `ENABLE_SELF_LINKS`
    - When enabled, links in representation will include reference to the current resource.
    - Default is True.

- New serializer fields, see `dynamic_rest.fields.model`
    - These fields extend the base DRF fields with dynamic value behavior.

- New serializer method: `get_url`
    - Returns a URL to the serializer's collection or detail endpoint,
      dependening on whether a PK is passed in.

    - The URL key can be injected into the serializer by the router when
      the serializer's view is registered. If not, this method will fallback
      to `DynamicRouter.get_canonical_url`.

- New serializer method: `get_field`
    - Returns a serializer field by name. Can also pass in "pk" as shorthand

- New serializer method: `resolve`
    - Provides a consistent way to resolve an API-field
      into a chain of model fields. Returns a model field list
      and serializer field list.

    - For example, consider the API field `creator.location_name`
      on a `BlogSerializer` and underlying model path 
      `user.location.name` starting from the `Blog` model.
      `BlogSerializer.resolve("creator.location_name")`
      will return two paths of model and serializer fields necessary
      to "reach" the field from the serializer.

    ```
        [
            ("user", blog.user),
            ("location", user.location),
            ("name", location.name)
        ],
        [
            ("creator", DynamicRelationField("UserSerializer", source="user")),
            ("location_name", DynamicCharField(source="location.name"))
        ]
    ```

    - The two lists do not necessarily contain the same number of elements
      because API fields can reference nested model fields.

    - Calling resolve on a method field (`source == '*'`) will cause an exception.

- New serializer functionality: **nested updates**
    - DREST serializers will now attempt to properly handle
      nested-source fields during updates.
    
    - For example, if there is a user with related `profile`,
      a `UserSerializer` for the user can support updates
      to the related profile phone by creating a field with
      the nested source "profile.phone". Updates to the phone field
      will be set on the profile object, which is then saved.

    - If related objects do not exist, the serializer will attempt
      to craete it using the fields in the request.
      Multiple fields on a related model can be mapped.

## Views

- Fixed `sort[]` behavior around rewrites
    - API-name to model-name rewrites are now properly handled by `sort[]`.

- New views: `dynamic_rest.login` and `dynamic_rest.logout`
    - Wraps `django.contrib.auth.views` login and logout
      using the DREST admin login template.

## Routers

- Renamed option: `ROOT_VIEW_NAME` renamed to `API_NAME`
    - Human-friendly name of the API.

- New option: `API_DESCRIPTION`
    - Human-friendly description of the API.

- New option: `API_ROOT_SECURE`
    - If enabled, the root view will redirect if the user is not authenticated.
    - Default is False.

## Renderers

- New renderer: `dynamic_rest.renderers.DynamicAdminRenderer`
    - Extends `rest_framework.renderers.AdminRenderer`, adding a
      new, responsively designed admin UI that integrates with DREST filters
      and relationships.
    
    - Serializers from 1.x should work as expected, but are recommended to set
      the following configuration options in their `Meta` class to support an
      ideal experience.
        - `name_field`: a human-friendly field name for records
            - defaults to the model PK
            - used for relationship lookup and representation
            - e.g. `"name"`
        - `search_key`: a filter key to search against to find records of this resource
            - defaults to None
            - used for search
            - e.g: `"filter{name.icontains}"`
        - `list_fields`: a list of fields to display within long lists
            - defaults to all fields
            - used for displaying the list view
            - e.g. `["name", "description"]`
        - `description`: a description of the resource
            - e.g: "The Build resource represents a backend build."

- New option: `ADMIN_LOGIN_URL`
    - The login URL to use within the admin UI.

- New option: `ADMIN_LOGOUT_URL`
    - The logout URL to use within the admin UI.

- New option: `ADMIN_TEMPLATE`
    - Template file name for the admin view.
    - Defaults to "dynamic_rest/admin.html"
    - Customizations are possible by settings `ADMIN_TEMPLATE` to an
      application-specific template, e.g. "app/admin.html".
    - Common blocks to override: `bootstrap_css`, `brand`.
    - The base UI is implemented in and requires Bootstrap 4.

- New option: `ADMIN_LOGIN_TEMPLATE`
    - Template file name for the admin login view.
    - Defaults to "dynamic_rest/login.html"
