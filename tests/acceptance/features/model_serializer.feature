    Scenario: Create endpoint should return errors when passing a bad request
    referencing a non-existent related model record.
      Given a "Country" model is available
        And a "Car" model is available
        And the request has "name" with "Tesla"
        And the request has "country" with 42
        When I make an API "POST" request to "/cars" with data
        Then status code "400" is returned
        And values exist in the response
        | country |
        | Invalid value for 'country': Country object with ID=42 not found |

    Scenario: Create endpoint should 201 on success
    referencing a non-existent related model record.
      Given a "Country" with values
        | name                     | short_name |
        | United States of America | USA        |
        And a "Car" model is available
        And the request has "name" with "Tesla"
        And the request has "country" with 1
        When I make an API "POST" request to "/cars" with data
        Then status code "201" is returned
        And values exist in "car" in the response
        | name  |
        | Tesla |
